You can switch between targets by swiping the screen

Swipe left to move to the next character, and swipe right to go back to the previous character

Some options for fixed and character camera are provided

You can change those from the option dialog

A button to open the option dialog will be added to the MV select screen

Here are the explanation(s) for the options:

  In some MV, characters may become disappeared due to staging

  This option prevents it

By default, the script will dump MasterMusicAlls, MasterEventStories, MasterSpecialStoryMap and MasterUnitStoryEpisodeAll

You can easily change the dump targets by changing targetDataNameArray in the script

```
2. Install dependencies with this command:
